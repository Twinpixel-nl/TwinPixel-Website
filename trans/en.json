A Starter site can be ready within 2-3 weeks, while an Enterprise site may take 4-6 weeks. We always provide a realistic timeline at the start of the project. For an extra €99, you can request express delivery." },
        { "question": "What exactly is the hybrid pricing model?", "answer": "Our hybrid pricing model consists of two parts: a one-time fee for designing and building your website, and a monthly fee for hosting and small updates. This ensures your website is not only professionally set up but also runs smoothly and stays up-to-date without unexpected costs." },
        { "question": "What if I don’t have a logo or brand identity yet?", "answer": "No worries! We also offer logo and branding design as a separate service. We can help you design a professional logo and matching identity that perfectly aligns with your brand and target audience." },
        { "question": "What if I want to add content or updates myself?", "answer": "We offer packages with a Content Management System (CMS), so you can easily add text, images, and updates yourself. We’ll provide a short training so you can manage your website independently." }

     "faq": [
        { "question": "Are there hidden costs?", "answer": "No, at TwinPixel we believe in full transparency. The price we quote is the price you pay. There are no hidden costs or surprises." },
        { "question": "What if I have specific needs that don’t fit a package?", "answer": "No problem! We also offer custom solutions. Contact us to discuss your specific wishes and we'll create a tailored offer." },
        { "question": "What about hosting and domain registration?", "answer": "Hosting is included in the monthly amount of our hybrid pricing model. Domain registration is invoiced separately at cost. We can register your domain or help you transfer an existing one." },
        { "question": "Can I upgrade to another package later?", "answer": "Yes, you can always upgrade to a more extensive package. We only charge the difference between your current and new package, plus any additional work required." },
        { "question": "How long does it take for my website to be ready?", "answer": "The turnaround time depends on the chosen package and the complexity of your website. A Starter website can be ready within 2-3 weeks, while an Enterprise website can take 4-6 weeks. We always establish a realistic timeline at the beginning of the project." },
         { "question": "What are the payment terms?", "answer": "We ask for a 50% down payment at the start of the project. The remaining 50% is invoiced upon delivery of the website. The monthly fee for hosting and updates is invoiced monthly, starting from the launch of your website." },
        { "question": "What exactly is the hybrid pricing model?", "answer": "Our hybrid pricing model consists of two parts: a one-time fee for designing and building your website, and a monthly fee for hosting and small updates. This ensures your website is not only professionally set up, but also continues to run well and stays up-to-date without unexpected costs." }
